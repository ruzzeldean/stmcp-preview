One of the main advocacies of STAR is sharing what we can to the needy. We also promote selfless riders that always think not just of him/herself but also the welfare of the others. Share the road share the load. We will travel with a purpose (Leisure, Charities and Social Activities like tree planting, clean up drive etc.). Time will be well spent. We will also make sure that we will have time to share our weekends with our Families and love ones so we won't have weekly activities. Our activities will be limited to Bi-Weekly to give the members time to save and prepare.</div>
